# 🏋️‍♂️ **Training & Meal Recommendation System** 🍽️

## Overview
This project is a **training and meal recommendation system** designed for people who go to the gym or those looking to improve their overall health. Built with **Flask** (Python) for the backend and **ReactJS** for the frontend, this web application provides users with personalized workout routines and meal plans based on their goals and preferences. Additionally, the system integrates **RAG (Retrieve and Generate)** techniques using the **ChatGPT API** and **Pincone** (a vector database) to enhance the recommendation system with intelligent, dynamic suggestions.

Pincone allows the system to store, retrieve, and search for contextually relevant data to improve the responses generated by the ChatGPT API. This results in more accurate, personalized, and meaningful interactions with users, tailored to their specific fitness goals and dietary preferences.
